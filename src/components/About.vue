      I'm Etsubdink, a dedicated and motivated 4th-year Software Engineering student at Woldia University with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in developing both web and mobile applications. Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on various academic and personal projects that strengthened my skills in languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, Python, Dart (Flutter), Laravel, React, Vue.js, Django, C++, and Java. I am also familiar with essential tools and platforms including Git and RESTful APIs. I’m particularly passionate about building user-centered solutions, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my craft. I am currently seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my knowledge, gain real-world industry experience, and contribute meaningfully to a professional software development team.
